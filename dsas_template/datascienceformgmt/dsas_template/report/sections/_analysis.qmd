# Methods

While our project is primarily an exploratory data analysis (EDA), we used a statistical method to quantify the relationship between a movie's budget and its IMDb rating.

## Pearson Correlation Coefficient

To answer the question, "Is there a correlation between a film’s budget and its IMDb rating?", we used the **Pearson correlation coefficient**.

-   **Why this method?** The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is a measure of linear association between two continuous variables. It is the most common method for measuring correlation and is ideal for understanding both the strength and direction of a relationship. Our goal was to see if a linear relationship exists where higher budgets correspond to higher ratings.

-   **Assumptions**: The key assumptions for Pearson correlation are that the variables are approximately normally distributed and that the relationship between them is linear. Our EDA scatter plot (`@fig-budget-rating-correlation` in the EDA section) showed that while the relationship is weak, it doesn't appear to be strongly non-linear. We also used a log scale for the budget to handle the wide range of values, which helps in visualizing the linear trend.

-   **How it answers the question**: The coefficient ranges from -1 (perfect negative linear correlation) to +1 (perfect positive linear correlation), with 0 indicating no linear correlation. By calculating this value, we can quantitatively assess the "money vs. quality" debate.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-correlation-calculation
#| tbl-cap: "Pearson correlation between movie budget and IMDb rating"

import pandas as pd
from quarto_runtime import project_root

# Load the cleaned dataset
processed_data_path = project_root / "data" / "processed" / "Movie_Data_1920_to_2025_cleaned.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(processed_data_path, skipinitialspace=True)

# Filter out rows with missing budget or rating for this analysis
budget_rating_data = data.dropna(subset=['budget', 'rating'])

# Calculate the Pearson correlation
correlation = budget_rating_data['budget'].corr(budget_rating_data['rating'])

print("=== Pearson Correlation Result ===")
print(f"Correlation coefficient (r): {correlation:.4f}")
```

# Findings and Discussion

Our analysis aimed to determine if a higher budget translates to a better-received film, as measured by IMDb ratings.

-   **Finding**: The Pearson correlation coefficient between a movie's budget and its IMDb rating is **`{python} f'{correlation:.4f}'`**, as calculated in @tbl-correlation-calculation.

-   **Interpretation**: A correlation coefficient of `{python} f'{correlation:.4f}'` indicates a **very weak positive linear relationship**. This value is extremely close to zero, which suggests that there is virtually no meaningful linear association between how much a movie costs to make and how much the audience likes it.

-   **Connection to Research Question**: This directly answers our third sub-question. While there might be a perception that big-budget films are "better," our data does not support this. The lack of a strong correlation implies that financial investment is not a reliable predictor of audience appreciation.

-   **Domain Context**: This finding is significant for the film industry. It challenges the "blockbuster formula" that often relies on massive budgets to generate hits. It suggests that other factors—such as the quality of the script, the director's vision, and the actors' performances—are far more critical drivers of a film's quality and reception. It also validates the success of low-budget independent films that achieve high ratings, proving that creativity can triumph over capital.

-   **Limitations**: It is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Furthermore, this analysis only measures a *linear* relationship. It is possible that a more complex, non-linear relationship exists between budget and rating, though our EDA did not suggest one.

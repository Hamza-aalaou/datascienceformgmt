# Introduction

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to analyze the evolution of the global film industry from 1990 to 2025. We aim to understand how public tastes and film characteristics—such as genre, budget, duration, and country of origin—have changed over time. This topic is relevant as it connects art, culture, and data science, allowing us to use data to explore historical and cultural trends in entertainment. By transforming creative aspects of cinema into measurable patterns, we can gain insights into how technology, audience preferences, and globalization have shaped the movies we watch today. The analysis will focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify major trends and correlations.

## Writing Tip: Make it Relevant

Connect your project to real-world actuarial or insurance problems. For example, if analyzing claim data, explain how your insights could improve risk assessment or pricing strategies.

## Research Questions
Our primary research question is:
- How have public tastes and film characteristics (genres, budget, origins, duration) evolved in the global film industry between 1990 and 2025?

To address this, we will investigate the following sub-questions, each providing a different lens through which to view the industry's evolution:
- **Which film genres dominated each decade?** This question helps us understand changing cultural tastes and identify which storytelling formats were most popular in different eras.
- **How have movie budgets evolved over time?** Analyzing budget trends reveals the economic shifts in the film industry, from the rise of blockbusters to the impact of new technologies.
- **Is there a correlation between a film’s budget and its IMDb rating?** This explores whether higher financial investment typically translates into better audience reception, a key consideration for producers.
- **Are modern films longer than those from the 1990s?** The answer to this question can reflect changes in storytelling norms and audience viewing habits.
- **Which countries have dominated global film production over different periods?** This highlights the geographical shifts in filmmaking, showing the influence of globalization and the rise of new markets.
- **Do the highest-rated films consistently come from the same regions?** This question examines whether critical acclaim is concentrated in specific cultural or geographical areas.

## Related Work

Discuss relevant academic papers, methodologies, and prior research that informed your project. Include both domain-specific literature (actuarial science, insurance, finance) and methodological references (statistical methods, data science techniques).

**Example structure:**

- **Domain literature**: Academic papers on your topic (e.g., claims analysis, mortality modeling, risk assessment)
- **Methodological references**: Statistical methods or data science techniques you applied
- **Course materials**: @azizi2025dsas provides Python-based data science techniques for actuarial applications
- **Technical resources**: Books like @mckinney2022python and @vanderplas2016python for implementation details

## Academic Citations Recommended

Your Related Work section can have **more value when including academic papers (further evidence)** from peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings, not just books or course materials. Use Google Scholar, university library databases, or specialized actuarial journals to find relevant papers.

**Recommended sources:**

- Academic journals (Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, ASTIN Bulletin, Journal of Risk and Insurance)
- Conference papers (actuarial conferences, data science symposiums)
- Working papers from researchers in your field

**Citation example**: "@azizi2022realestate investigated multi-modal approaches to real estate rental price prediction, demonstrating that models combining tabular data with visual information (property images and satellite imagery) outperform traditional methods relying solely on structured features. Their supervised learning framework fused dedicated neural network branches for each data type, achieving superior performance on 11,105 Swiss rental listings." *(This reference is already in your `references.bib` file and can be cited as `@azizi2022realestate`)*

## Citing Sources

Always cite your sources properly! In Quarto, use `@citation_key` syntax. The bibliography will be automatically generated from the `references.bib` file.

**Example**: `@azizi2025dsas` renders as: @azizi2025dsas

Add entries to `references.bib` in [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/) format for all sources you cite (every article normally generates BibTeX, otherwise search an online tool that does it).

::: {.callout-warning}
## Avoiding Plagiarism

Make sure to cite all sources that informed your work, including:

- Datasets (with URLs)
- Methods or techniques from papers or tutorials
- Code snippets adapted from online resources
- Inspiration from existing analyses

When in doubt, cite it!

## Common Mistake

Don't just list your research questions without context. Explain **why** each question matters and **how** it relates to your dataset and project goals.

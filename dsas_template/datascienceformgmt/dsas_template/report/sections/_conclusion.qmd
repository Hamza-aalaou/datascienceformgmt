# Conclusion

## Summary

This project set out to analyze the evolution of the global film industry from 1990 to 2025 by exploring trends in movie characteristics and audience preferences. Using a comprehensive IMDb dataset from Kaggle, we performed a thorough data cleaning process and conducted an exploratory data analysis to answer our key research questions.

Our main findings reveal a dynamic and evolving industry:

-   **Genre Trends**: While **Drama** and **Comedy** remain consistently popular, the 21st century has seen a significant rise in the production of **Action** and **Thriller** films, likely driven by advancements in technology and a global market for spectacle.
-   **Economic Shifts**: We observed a clear and steady increase in the median movie **budget** over the past three decades, confirming that filmmaking has become a more expensive endeavor.
-   **Quality vs. Cost**: Our analysis showed a **very weak positive correlation** between a film's budget and its IMDb rating. This critical insight suggests that financial investment does not guarantee audience appreciation; creativity and storytelling remain paramount.
-   **Film Duration**: We found a slight but consistent upward trend in the average movie **duration**, supporting the common perception that films are getting longer.
-   **Global Production**: The **United States** continues to dominate in production volume, but other countries like the **United Kingdom, Japan, and India** are also major, consistent contributors to the global film landscape, each with a significant number of highly-rated films.

## Limitations

It is important to acknowledge the constraints of our analysis to contextualize our findings properly:

-   **Data Bias**: The dataset is heavily skewed towards Hollywood and Western cinema. Consequently, our findings on "global" trends may not fully capture the nuances of film industries in other parts of the world, such as Asia, Africa, or South America.
-   **Missing Data**: A significant number of films, particularly older or independent ones, were missing financial data (e.g., `budget`, `gross_worldwide`). While we handled this by excluding them from specific financial analyses, their absence could slightly skew the results.
-   **No Inflation Adjustment**: The financial data used in this report has not been adjusted for inflation. This means that the observed increase in movie budgets is likely even more pronounced in real terms.
-   **Subjective Ratings**: IMDb ratings are user-generated and can be influenced by cultural biases, targeted campaigns (e.g., "review bombing"), or the specific demographics of the platform's user base.
-   **Methodological Scope**: Our analysis is exploratory in nature. While we have identified interesting correlations, we cannot establish causal relationships between variables.

## Future Work

Based on our findings and limitations, we propose the following steps for completing the report and for future analysis:

#### Next Steps for the Final Report

1.  **Refine Narrative**: Review and enhance the interpretations in the EDA and Analysis sections to ensure a clear and compelling story.
2.  **Final Proofread**: Conduct a thorough review of the entire report for grammatical errors, consistency, and clarity.
3.  **Check All References**: Ensure all figures and tables are correctly labeled and referenced in the text using Quarto's `@fig-` and `@tbl-` syntax.
4.  **Prepare Presentation**: Synthesize the key findings into a concise and visually engaging presentation for the final delivery.

#### Future Analytical Work

1.  **Adjust for Inflation**: A crucial next step would be to adjust all financial data to a constant dollar value (e.g., 2025 USD). This would allow for a more accurate and meaningful comparison of budgets and revenues across different decades.
2.  **Build a Predictive Model**: To move beyond correlation, a regression model could be built to identify the most significant predictors of a movie's `gross_worldwide` revenue or `rating`. This could incorporate variables like genre, budget, duration, and even the popularity of its director or lead actors.
3.  **Deeper Genre Analysis**: Instead of just using the primary genre, future work could analyze the impact of genre *combinations*. Natural Language Processing (NLP) on movie descriptions could also be used to create more nuanced genre classifications.
4.  **Geographical Deep Dive**: A more focused analysis on the film industries of specific non-US countries (e.g., India, South Korea, Nigeria) could reveal unique trends and patterns that are missed in a global-level overview.
